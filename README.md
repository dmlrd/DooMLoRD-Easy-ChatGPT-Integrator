## Pre-requisites

**OpenAI API Key** - We will be using OpenAI's APIs for which we will need the API keys for authentication with OpenAI servers. Visit your [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests. OpenAI provides this as a paid service for higher volumes, but initially it gives you some credits to use for free.

**Admin Access to MS Team** - I don't think you can do this without the Admin access, but someone can check and let me know

**Power Automate License / Free Plan** - Free Plan provided by Power Automate for 3 months
